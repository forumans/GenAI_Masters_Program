Project: Intelligent User Feedback Analysis and Action System 

Business Problem: 
Modern SaaS and app-based companies receive dozens of user reviews and feedback 
daily from multiple channels including app stores (Google Play, App Store), customer 
support emails, and user surveys. The current manual triaging process is slow, 
inconsistent, and doesn't scale effectively resulting in critical bugs being missed, feature 
requests being delayed, and inconsistent prioritization across teams. 

Scenario:
You are a product engineer at a B2C mobile app company that manages a productivity 
app with around 10,000 active users. Your team currently receives: 
• 10-20 app store reviews daily 
• 5-10 customer support emails per day 
• Occasional in-app feedback submissions 
A team member manually reads through this feedback and creates tickets in your project 
management system. This process takes 1-2 hours daily and often results in: 
• Delayed response to critical bugs 
• Inconsistent ticket formatting and prioritization 
• Lost or overlooked feedback 
• Poor traceability from user complaint to engineering resolution 

Your Task: Complete Project Implementation 
Design, implement, and demonstrate a complete multi-agent AI system that: 
1. Reads user feedback from CSV files containing app store reviews and support 
emails 
2. Classifies content into categories (Bug / Feature Request / Praise / Complaint / 
Spam) 
3. Extracts actionable insights and technical details 
4. Creates structured tickets and logs them to CSV files with appropriate priority 
levels and metadata 
5. Ensures quality and consistency through automated review 
6. Provides a user interface for monitoring and manual overrides 


System Objectives:
Your complete system should achieve: 
• Automation: Process feedback from CSV files without manual intervention 
• Speed: Complete analysis and ticket creation within minutes 
• Consistency: Standardize ticket format and priority assignment 
• Traceability: Maintain clear links from original feedback to generated tickets 
• Usability: Provide an intuitive interface for monitoring and control 

Multi-Agent Architecture to Implement:
Table: Agent -> Primary Responsibilities 
CSV Reader Agent -> Reads and parses feedback data from CSV files 
Feedback Classifier Agent -> Categorizes feedback using NLP (bug, feature request, praise, complaint, spam) 
Bug Analysis Agent -> Extracts technical details: steps to reproduce, platform info, severity assessment 
Feature Extractor Agent -> Identifies feature requests and estimates user impact/demand
Ticket Creator Agent  -> Generates structured tickets and logs them to output CSV files 
Quality Critic Agent  -> Reviews generated tickets for completeness and accuracy 


Technical Implementation Requirements:
• Framework: CrewAI or AutoGen for agent orchestration 
• UI: Streamlit for monitoring and manual overrides 
• Input: Read from CSV files containing mock feedback data 
• Output: Log generated tickets to CSV files for offline analysis 
• Error Handling: Robust error handling and logging 
• Configuration: Configurable parameters for classification thresholds and 
priorities 

Step 1: Create Mock Dataset CSV Files:
First, create the following CSV files with realistic sample data: 
1. app_store_reviews.csv  
Columns: review_id, platform, rating, review_text, user_name, date, app_version 
Hints: 
• Bug examples: "App crashes when I...", "Can't login since update", "Data sync not 
working" 
• Feature requests: "Please add...", "Would love to see...", "Missing functionality..." 
• Praise: "Amazing app!", "Love the new feature", "Works perfectly" 
• Complaints: "Too expensive", "Poor customer service", "App is slow" 
• Spam: Promotional text, random characters, unrelated content 
• Mix platforms: Include both "Google Play" and "App Store" 
• Vary ratings: 1-5 stars, with bugs typically 1-2, features 3-4, praise 4-5 
• Realistic versions: "2.1.3", "3.0.1", etc. 

2. support_emails.csv  
Columns: email_id, subject, body, sender_email, timestamp, priority 
Hints: 
• Bug subjects: "App Crash Report", "Login Issue", "Data Loss Problem" 
• Feature subjects: "Feature Request: Dark Mode", "Suggestion for Improvement" 
• Include technical details: Device models, OS versions, steps to reproduce 
• Vary email styles: Formal business emails vs casual user messages 
• Include timestamps: Recent dates in various formats 
• Priority levels: Leave some blank, others with "High", "Medium", "Low"

3. expected_classifications.csv  
Columns: source_id, source_type, category, priority, technical_details, suggested_title 
Hints: 
• Map to your reviews/emails: Use same IDs from above files 
• Categories: Bug, Feature Request, Praise, Complaint, Spam 
• Priorities: Critical, High, Medium, Low 
• Technical details: For bugs, include device info, reproduction steps 
• Suggested titles: Clear, actionable ticket titles 


Step 2: System Implementation:
Implement the complete multi-agent system including: 
Core Components: 
1. Agent Classes: Implement each agent with specific responsibilities 
2. Data Processing Pipeline: CSV reading, processing, and output generation 
3. Classification Logic: NLP-based categorization with confidence scores 
4. Ticket Generation: Structured output with proper formatting 
5. Quality Control: Validation and review mechanisms 
User Interface: 
• Dashboard: Overview of processed feedback and generated tickets 
• Configuration Panel: Adjust classification thresholds and priorities 
• Manual Override: Edit or approve generated tickets 
• Analytics: Show processing statistics and performance metrics 
Output Files: 
• generated_tickets.csv: Final ticket output with proper structure 
• processing_log.csv: Detailed processing history and decisions 
• metrics.csv: Performance and accuracy metrics 


Step 3: Demonstration and Testing 
Create a complete demo showing: 
1. Data ingestion from your mock CSV files 
2. Real-time processing with agent interactions 
3. Classification accuracy compared to expected results 
4. Ticket generation with proper formatting 
5. User interface functionality and monitoring 
6. Error handling and edge case management
